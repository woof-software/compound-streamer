## Streamer

This contract streams a certain amount of native asset in a form of streaming asset to the recipient over a specified streaming duration.
The contract is designed to work with a pair of Chainlink oracles: Native Asset / USD and Streaming Asset / USD. However, can support any oracle which supports AggregatorV3Interface.
Streaming asset is accrued linearly over a streaming duration, unlocking a portion of Streaming asset each second. Recipient can claim any time during and after the stream.
Stream Creator is able to:
    * rescue any ERC-20 token stuck in contract except of streaming asset.
    * terminate the stream until the stream end. In this case, the distribution of streaming asset will continue till the termination timestamp.
    * sweep remaining streaming asset tokens after stream end or termination timestamp (in case the stream is terminated).
The streaming amount is specified in the native asset units. During the claiming, accrued native asset amount is calculated into streaming asset.
All the tokens transferred via sweepRemaining or rescueToken are sent to the returnAddress.
Anyone is able to call claim or sweepRemaining after a specified duration. Assets will still be transferred to the recipient and returnAddress accordingly.

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(contract IERC20 _streamingAsset, contract AggregatorV3Interface _streamingAssetOracle, contract AggregatorV3Interface _nativeAssetOracle, address _returnAddress, address _streamCreator, address _recipient, uint8 _streamingAssetDecimals, uint8 _nativeAssetDecimals, uint256 _nativeAssetStreamingAmount, uint256 _slippage, uint256 _claimCooldown, uint256 _sweepCooldown, uint256 _streamDuration, uint256 _minimumNoticePeriod) public
```

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize() external
```

Initializes the stream by setting start timestamp and validating that the contract has enough Streaming asset.
Streaming asset must be transferred to the contract's balance before function is called.
Note. It is recommended to send a sufficient amount of Streaming asset in order to ensure the correct work of the Streamer.
The extra amount depends of the volatility of assets. In general, we recommend sending extra 10% of the necessary Streaming asset amount.
Use the function `calculateStreamingAssetAmount` to determine the amount of Streaming asset to transfer.

### claim

```solidity
function claim() external
```

Claims the accrued amount of Streaming asset to the recipient's balance.

_The stream must be initialized.
Can be called by the recipient or anyone after claim cooldown has passed since the last claim timestamp.
In case the contract doesn't have enough Streaming asset on its balance, the whole balance will be sent. The stream owner will have to replenish
the balance in order to resume the stream._

### terminateStream

```solidity
function terminateStream(uint256 _terminationTimestamp) external
```

Terminates the stream, stopping the distribution after the termination timestamp.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| _terminationTimestamp | uint256 | The timestamp after which the stream is stopped. Must be longer than `block.timestamp + minimumNoticePeriod` and less than the end of stream. If the parameter is equal to 0, the termination timestamp will be set as `block.timestamp + minimumNoticePeriod`. |

### sweepRemaining

```solidity
function sweepRemaining() external
```

Allows to sweep all the Streaming asset tokens from the Streamer's balance.

_Can be called by Stream Creator before initialization without any additional conditions.
After the end of stream (Either after stream duration or after termination timestamp if termination was called), can be called
by Stream Creator or anyone after sweep cooldown has passed._

### rescueToken

```solidity
function rescueToken(contract IERC20 token) external
```

Allows to transfer any ERC-20 token except the Streaming asset from the Streamer's balance.

_Can only be called by Stream Creator._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| token | contract IERC20 | Address of ERC-20 token to transfer. |

### getNativeAssetAmountOwed

### calculateStreamingAssetAmount

```solidity

Calculates the amount of Streaming asset based on the specified Native asset amount.

#### Parameters

### calculateNativeAssetAmount

function calculateNativeAssetAmount(uint256 streamingAssetAmount) public view returns (uint256)
```

Calculates the amount of Native asset based on the specified Streaming asset amount.

_Used in `initialize` to validate if the Streamer has enough Streaming asset to begin stream.
Used in `claim` to calculate how much the remaining balance of Streaming asset is equal to the Native Asset
(For cases where the Streamer doesn't have enough Streaming asset to distribute)._
